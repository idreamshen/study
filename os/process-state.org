PROCESS STATE CODES         top
       Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output
       specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state
       of a process:

               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
               I    Idle kernel thread
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
               T    stopped by job control signal
               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by
                    its parent

       For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional
       characters may be displayed:

               <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
               N    low-priority (nice to other users)
               L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom
                    IO)
               s    is a session leader
               l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL
                    pthreads do)
               +    is in the foreground process group

- D 不可中断的睡眠状态（通常由 IO 操作产生）
- S 可中断睡眠状态（等待一个事件完成）
- I 空闲内核线程
- R 运行或可运行状态（在运行队列中）
- T 暂停状态
- t 跟踪状态
- Z 僵尸状态
- X 推出状态
